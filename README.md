# Lists
 These are two my implementations of a linked list
 The first one is based on pointers.
 The second one is based on an array, which allows to add new elements and to delete in O(1) in some cases.

# How to use
 To compile it, enter in the terminal
 ```
 $ make all
 ```
 Or you can compile them separately
 ```
 $ make list_ptr
 $ make list_arr
 ```

 # Here is an example of the list dump
